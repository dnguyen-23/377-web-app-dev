SELECT - what rows to list in the result set
FROM & JOIN - tells you what tables you are allowed to access and look at

ON - tells you the condition on the JOIN statement
    - Generally the ON statement is used for connecting the table to another table
    -   by doing foreign primary key = current primary key by doing 
    -   foreign.id  = current.foreign_column

GROUP BY - tells you how to group the COUNT() performed
    - Group counts by a specific field

ORDER BY - order by the original names; NOT the alias
    - NEVER HAVE COLUMN NAME THE SAME AS TABLE NAME; makes it very confusing


***
What's the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
    - The different depends on when you want to apply the condition 
    - with respect to GROUP BY

    - WHERE is used before the GROUP BY
    - WHERE is used on columns to filter out rows

    - HAVING is used after the GROUP BY
    - HAVING is used on groups made after GROUP BY
