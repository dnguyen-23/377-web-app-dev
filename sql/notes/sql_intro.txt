*SQL is not a programming language
-sql is a querying language


Databases : spreadsheets
tables : tab
row : row

In a database:
-every column represents an attribute
-every row/record represents an entry
-each table generally represents another entity (or class)

Attributes:
-each entity should have a primary key attribute (id attribute)
-entities can also have foreign keys that represent relationship 
with an entry from another entity

Result set: set of rows returned from query by a SELECT statement
Query: a command/request 

"Statements" are made up of "clauses"
-What's a clauses
--clauses are basically commands, generally starting with a keyword

ex. SELECT statement
SELECT * FROM Person;
clause 1.) SELECT *
clause 2.) FROM Person

*You should put each clause on its own line
